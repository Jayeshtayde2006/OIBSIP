Research Report on Social Engineering Attacks

Internship Task 5
Name: Jayesh Tayade
Role: Cybersecurity Intern
Date: 14-02-2026

1. Introduction

During this internship, I understood that cybersecurity is not only about firewalls, antivirus, and encryption. One of the biggest weaknesses in any system is human beings. Social engineering attacks target people instead of technology. These attacks manipulate individuals into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.

In India, with rapid digital transformation, UPI adoption, online banking, Aadhaar linking, and work-from-home culture, social engineering attacks are increasing at an alarming rate. This report explains different types of social engineering attacks, real-world case studies, their impact, and preventive measures.

2. What is Social Engineering?

Social engineering is a psychological manipulation technique used by attackers to trick individuals into giving sensitive information such as:

Passwords

OTPs

Bank details

Corporate login credentials

Confidential company information

Instead of hacking systems, attackers hack human trust.

3. Types of Social Engineering Attacks
3.1 Phishing
Explanation

Phishing is the most common social engineering attack. The attacker sends fraudulent emails, messages, or websites pretending to be legitimate organisations such as banks, government portals, or companies.

How It Works

Victim receives email/SMS appearing from trusted source.

Message creates urgency (account blocked, KYC expired, parcel undelivered).

Victim clicks malicious link.

Fake website collects login credentials or card details.

Indian Context

In India, phishing messages often pretend to be from:

SBI

HDFC Bank

ICICI Bank

Income Tax Department

Electricity Board

UPI platforms

Case Study: COVID-19 Relief Scam (India)

During COVID-19, attackers sent fake government relief scheme links. Many citizens entered Aadhaar and bank details, resulting in financial fraud.

Impact

Financial loss

Identity theft

Corporate data breach

Loss of public trust

Prevention

Verify sender email domain

Never click suspicious links

Enable multi-factor authentication

Employee phishing awareness training

3.2 Spear Phishing
Explanation

Spear phishing is a targeted phishing attack. Instead of mass emails, attacker researches specific individual or organisation.

Example

An employee receives email appearing from company HR asking to update payroll details.

Indian Case Study

In 2016, several Indian IT companies reported payroll diversion scams where finance departments were tricked into transferring salary funds to fraudulent accounts.

Prevention

Email verification policies

Approval workflow for financial transactions

DMARC, SPF, DKIM email security standards

3.3 Pretexting
Explanation

Pretexting is when attacker creates a fake identity or story to obtain information.

How It Works

Attacker pretends to be bank officer

Calls victim asking to verify KYC

Asks for OTP or card details

Indian Example

Fake RBI or bank officers calling elderly citizens for “KYC update” and collecting OTPs.

Impact

Bank account emptied

Personal data theft

Prevention

Banks must educate customers

Never share OTP

Awareness campaigns

3.4 Baiting
Explanation

Baiting involves offering something attractive to lure victims.

Examples

Free movie download links

Free government job application forms

Free cracked software

USB drives dropped in office

Indian Scenario

Students downloading pirated software or exam papers which contain malware.

Impact

Malware infection

Ransomware

Data theft

Prevention

Avoid pirated content

Restrict USB access in offices

Install antivirus

3.5 Vishing (Voice Phishing)
Explanation

Voice-based phishing using phone calls.

Indian Example

Fraudsters calling and saying:

“Your Aadhaar will be blocked”

“Your SIM card will be deactivated”

“Your bank account is frozen”

Victims panic and share OTP.

Prevention

Verify through official website

Never share OTP

Block suspicious numbers

3.6 Smishing (SMS Phishing)
Explanation

SMS-based phishing attacks.

Example in India

“Dear Customer, your bank account will be suspended. Click here to update KYC.”

Prevention

Do not click unknown SMS links

Install official banking apps only

4. Major Real-World Social Engineering Cases
4.1 Cosmos Bank Cyber Attack (Pune, 2018)

Attackers used malware and social engineering to withdraw over ₹94 crore through ATM network compromise.

Impact:

Huge financial loss

Damage to banking reputation

4.2 AIIMS Delhi Cyber Attack (2022)

Though primarily ransomware, social engineering is often entry point through phishing emails.

Impact:

Patient records inaccessible

National level concern

4.3 Twitter Bitcoin Scam (Global Example)

Attackers used social engineering to gain internal employee access and posted scam tweets from verified accounts.

5. Impact on Organisations

Financial losses

Legal penalties

Data privacy violations

Reputational damage

Customer trust loss

In India, companies are also governed by:

IT Act 2000

CERT-In guidelines

RBI cybersecurity framework

Non-compliance can lead to penalties.

6. Preventive Measures
6.1 Employee Awareness Training

Regular training sessions on:

Phishing detection

Secure password practices

Incident reporting

6.2 Multi-Factor Authentication

Even if password is compromised, second layer protects access.

6.3 Strong Email Security

Spam filters

Anti-phishing gateways

DMARC implementation

6.4 Incident Response Plan

Companies must have defined steps:

Detect

Isolate

Investigate

Recover

6.5 Public Awareness

Government campaigns like:

Cyber Swachhta Kendra

Digital India awareness programs

7. Conclusion

As an intern, I realised that social engineering attacks are more dangerous than technical attacks because they exploit human psychology. In India, due to rapid digital growth and lack of cybersecurity awareness among common citizens, these attacks are increasing daily.

Technology alone cannot solve this issue. Awareness, training, and vigilance are equally important. Prevention is always better than recovery.

This research helped me understand the importance of human factor in cybersecurity and why organisations must focus on awareness along with technical controls.
